# Cypress Personal Project 
This personal project focuses on testing a sample web application and demonstrates my skills in using Cypress with TypeScript, for creating effective end-to-end tests.

Key components include:

* TypeScript Integration: Utilising TypeScript for improved code quality and type safety.
* Cypress Framework: Using Cypress for its robust and QA / developer-friendly testing environment.
* Basic Test Suite: A collection of automated tests covering essential user scenarios and functionality.
* Page Object Model: POM design pattern for reusable and easy to maintain code.
* Documentation: Documented code to clearly describe the methods and tests

# Running Tests
The tests can be run by using the following commands in the terminal:

* npx cypress open (run the tests in open mode with the test runner UI present to see the tests in action).
* npx cypress run (run the tests in headless mode. The test runner UI will not be present. Test results will be recorded directly in the terminal).
