# Cypress Personal Project
This repository features my personal project using Cypress and TypeScript to demonstrate my skills in end-to-end testing. 

The project focuses on testing a sample web application, highlighting key abilities in setting up and executing tests. 

Key components include:

* TypeScript Integration: Utilising TypeScript for improved code quality and type safety.
* Cypress Framework: Using Cypress for its robust and QA/developer-friendly testing environment.
* Basic Test Suite: A collection of automated tests covering essential user scenarios and functionality.
* Test Organisation: Using the page object model test structure with well-commented code for easy understanding and maintenance.
* Documentation: Basic documentation to guide users through the setup and execution of the tests.
* This project illustrates my capability in using Cypress and TypeScript for creating effective end-to-end tests.

# Running Tests
You can run the tests in the project in the following ways:

* npx cypress open (runs the tests in open mode with the test runner visible)
* npx cypress run (runs the tests in headless mode in the terminal without the test runner)
